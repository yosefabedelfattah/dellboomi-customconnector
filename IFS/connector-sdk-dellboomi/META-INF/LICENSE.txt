EXHIBIT A



Description of the Boomi SDK

The Boomi SDK is a toolkit that enables a Java developer to build a Boomi Connector. A Boomi Connector is a software component that

connects an Application to the AtomSphere. Once connected, that Application can integrate with any of the hundreds of Applications supported

by Boomi. This is key to Boomi’s unique “Connect once, integrate everywhere” approach to integration. The Boomi SDK is based on Java 1.6,

and provides facilities for publishing (private or public) a Boomi Connector, updating a Boomi Connector, and a test harness for initial and

ongoing testing requirements. The entire experience is designed to be self-service, enabling the Boomi Connector developer to build, publish

and manage their Boomi Connector on the Boomi AtomSphere.

A Boomi Connector is a small Application module that wraps and “describes” an Application Programming Interface (API) so that it can be

utilized without requiring programming skills. The Boomi Atom then invokes the Boomi Connector at runtime to interact with a particular Application, such as to add new data or read data from the Application.

Once created, this Boomi Connector completely abstracts the technical details described above from the End User. The End User simply logs

in to Boomi AtomSphere, specifies the Application they wish to connect, and walks through a wizard that prompts them for information on how

to connect to said Application, what exactly they want to integrate, etc.
